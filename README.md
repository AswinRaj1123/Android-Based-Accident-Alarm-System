# Algorithm:
*Step 1:* Start
*Step 2:* Set threshold values for sensors
*Step 3:* Calculate Sensors Values
                If(sensor values<threshold values)
                           Go to Step 3
                Else
                           Go to Step 4
*Step 4:* Get GPS coordinates
*Step 5:* Send the information to the help center
*Step 6:* Help Centre contacts the nearest hospital by GPS coordinates
*Step 7:* If(Hospital approves)
                          Go to Step 8
             Else
                          Go to Step 6
*Step 8:* Send an ambulance or rescue team to Location
*Step 9:* Stop

# Conclusion:
The Android-based Accident & Alarm System is a comprehensive solution aimed at enhancing road safety and emergency response through technology. Its implementation can lead to a significant reduction in fatalities and injuries resulting from road accidents.
